# Pop-K

Pop-K is a generative MIDI model that creates pop melodies in C major and A minor. Built on RWKV-4, the architecture employs a pseudo-linear attention mechanism for efficient training and fast inference. The model was trained on ~300k 8-bar melody samples composed of augmented mixes of bass, chords and vocal/lead melodies.
